## Biography
 
| <br> **Pengfei Zuo** is a research scientist at Huawei Cloud. He received his Ph.D. degree (advised by [Prof. Yu Hua](https://csyhua.github.io/csyhua/index.html)) in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2019, and was a visiting PhD student (advised by [Prof. Yuan Xie](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~yuanxie/)) in University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) during 2018-2019. He received B.E. degree in Computer Science from HUST in 2014. <br><br>He has published 30+ refereed papers in major conferences and journals (OSDI, MICRO, ASPLOS, FAST, USENIX ATC, DAC, etc) in the areas of computer system and architecture, with a focus on memory systems, storage systems and techniques, and security. He obtained [2020 ACM China Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.acmturc.com/2021/cn/doctoral_thesis_award.html) (only two awardees among all computer disciplines across China every year). <br><br> He served as a PC member at ICDCS 2021, Cloud 2021, CloudCom 2020, and ICPADS 2020. <br> <br> **Email:** <pfzuo.cs@gmail.com>, <pfzuo@hust.edu.cn>   <br> <br> | <br> &emsp; ![image](https://pfzuo.github.io/images/zuo-2021.jpg) <br> <br> |
